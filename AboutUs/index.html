  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Information We Collect:</strong> We collect customer information including name, shipping address, email address, and order details when you place an order.</p>
  <p><strong>How We Use Your Information:</strong> Your information is used solely for processing, producing, and shipping your order, and for warranty purposes.</p>
  <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We store order details—including your name, shipping address, email, and order information—for at least one (1) year after the order date. This allows us to process returns, exchanges, and warranty claims. After this period, your data may be permanently deleted from both customer and administrator systems.</p>
  <p><strong>Sharing Your Information:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except when required by law or for shipping purposes.</p>
  <p><strong>Security:</strong> We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
  <p><strong>1. Orders & Payment</strong><br>
    All orders must be paid in full before production begins. Prices are listed in USD and may change without prior notice.
  </p>
  <p><strong>2. Shipping</strong><br>
    We aim to ship all orders promptly after production. Shipping times may vary based on your location and the size of your order.
  </p>
  <p><strong>3. Cancellations & Refunds</strong><br>
    Orders can be cancelled before production begins. Due to the custom nature of our products, we generally do not offer refunds once production has started, unless the product is defective or damaged during shipping.

    By placing a custom order, you confirm that you own the rights to any designs you provide or have permission to use them.
